        "# The quantum version of a NOT gate\n",
        "In classical programming, a [NOT gate](https://bit.ly/2SmqonO) turns a 0 into a 1, and vice-versa. The quantum version of a NOT gate is the [X gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli-X_gate), often referred to as the Pauli-X gate. It turns a quantum state 0, symbolized in Dirac notation by $\\vert0\\rangle$, into a $\\vert1\\rangle$, and vice-versa. It also operates on states that are in some combination, or *superposition*, of $\\vert0\\rangle$and $\\vert1\\rangle$. To demonstrate the X gate, we'll create a simple quantum circuit with the [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) framework after we've installe the Qiskit libraries and imported the necessary items.\n",
