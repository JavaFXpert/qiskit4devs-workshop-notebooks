        "# The quantum version of a NOT gate\n",
        "In classical programming, a [NOT gate](https://bit.ly/2SmqonO) turns a 0 bit into a 1 bit, and vice-versa. The quantum version of a NOT gate is the X gate, often referred to as the [Pauli-X gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli-X_gate). It turns a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) symbolized in a [Dirac notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation \"Dirac notation article on Wikipedia\") _ket_ by $\\vert0\\rangle$ into a $\\vert1\\rangle$, and vice-versa. These $\\vert0\\rangle$ and $\\vert1\\rangle$ qubits are quantum states, specifically _computational basis states_, and they are the quantum counterparts of the classical 0 and 1 bits. The X gate also operates on quantum states that are in some combination, or *superposition*, of the $\\vert0\\rangle$and $\\vert1\\rangle$ computational basis states. To demonstrate the X gate, we'll create a simple quantum circuit with the [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) framework after we've imported the necessary items.\n",
