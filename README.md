# Learning Qiskit: Guided exercises for developers
Jupyter notebooks containing guided exercises for developers learining quantum computing with Qiskit.

## Instructions
These notebooks may be run in the cloud, or downloaded and run locally:

**To run in Google Colaboratory (in the cloud):** Ensure that you have a Google account, and navigate to your desired notebook in this repository. Click the **Open in Colab** icon at the top the notebook.
Note: The first cell in each of the notebooks installs Qiskit into the user's Colaboratory environment, so there is a bit of a delay and lots of output during this process.  

**To run locally:** Clone or download this repository, and install the Qiskit foundational libraries in a Python environment using the instructions on the [Qiskit Terra site](https://qiskit.org/terra).

## Guided exercises (recommended to do in this order)
#### [The quantum version of a NOT gate](./multi_qubit_circuits.ipynb)
This guided exercise is an introduction to creating a single-wire quantum circuit using Qiskit, and to the Pauli-X gate. It also introduces *qubits*, including various ways to represent and visualize them. 

#### Flipping a coin quantumly
This guided exercise introduces the Hadamard gate, quantum superpositions, probability amplitudes, and measurement probabilities. It also serves as a gentle introduction to Dirac notation.

#### Multi-qubit quantum circuits
This guided exercise builds on the previous one by creating circuits with multiple qubits, and examining their quantum state vectors. It also demonstrates how quantums states may be visualized.
